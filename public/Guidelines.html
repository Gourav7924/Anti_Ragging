                    <p>Ragging, a practice rooted in intimidation and humiliation, has caused irreparable damage to
                        countless lives. Recognizing its devastating impact on individuals and educational institutions,
                        the Anti-Ragging Mission stands as a firm commitment to fostering a safe, respectful, and
                        inclusive environment for students.</p>

                    <p>Our mission is to eradicate the menace of ragging by promoting awareness, enforcing strict
                        policies, and providing a robust support system for victims. We believe that every student
                        deserves to pursue their education free from fear, harassment, or discrimination. Through
                        collaborative efforts involving students, faculty, and authorities, we aim to cultivate a
                        culture of empathy, equality, and mutual respect.</p>

                    <p>Anti-Ragging Mission not only seeks to prevent ragging but also empowers victims to voice their
                        grievances without hesitation. From filing complaints to ensuring timely resolutions, our
                        platform ensures transparency and accountability at every step. With dedicated disciplinary
                        committees, counseling services, and awareness programs, we strive to educate and transform
                        mindsets, making ragging a relic of the past.
